# CarParkingSystem
This C++ project implements a Car Parking System with a text-based menu. Users can display parking slots, park cars, remove cars, and exit. It manages slots efficiently and provides real-time updates on slot availability. Ideal for learning C++ concepts like arrays, loops, and user input.
The system allows users to manage parking slots efficiently by providing functionalities to display the status of parking slots, park cars in available slots, remove cars from occupied slots, and exit the application. Users can interact with the system through a menu that offers four main options: displaying the current status of all parking slots, parking a car in a specified slot, removing a car from a specified slot, and exiting the application. The code uses an array to track the status of parking slots, ensuring real-time updates on their availability. This project is an excellent way to learn and practice basic C++ programming concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
